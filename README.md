I am currenty working at laboratory EOR - PT Pertamina (Persero) RTI

## PROJECT

1. Study Acid Stimulation of Bekapai, Handil, and Tambora Field.\
    Comparing mineral of rock between before chemical contact and after chemical contact.
3. Study Digital Rock Analysis.\
    Comparing result of porosity and permeability between RCA test and simulator. 
4. Study of CO2 Injection of Sukowati Field.\
    performing CO2 flooding to determine reability of equipment.
5. Study of CEOR Minas Field, Bangko Field and Rantau Field.\
    Performing test of chemical to determine performance based on recovery factor of oil using coreflooding equipment.
5. Study of MMP injection of Jatibarang Field.\
    Performing minimum miscible pressure of CO2 for JTB Field. CO2 is injected to equipment which have saturated by oil with various pressure to determine MMP.
6. Study of Imbibition, Huff and Puff Jirak Field.\
    Spontaneous imbibition of core plug is a method to determine recovery of oil. Cleaning and drying, routine core analysis (RCA), and saturation of water and oil are procedure that should finish before imbibition test. 
7. Study of Surfactant and Polymer flooding for Jirak Field.\
    Preliminary study of surfactant and polymer is screening test. Surfactant and polymer is performed with several method based on SKK MIGAS requirement. IFT, CMC, solubility test, phase behaviour, thermal stability, and filtration test have been done to get surfactant and polymer performance.
8. Study Well Stimulation of Mutiara Field.\
    Performing chemical test in core plug to determine permeability of core plug. Permeability before testing is compared with permeability after testing. Before testing, screening of core plug is done by routine core analysis. testing is done by using coreflooding equipment.
